<!-- ##### SECTION Title ##### -->
TnyCamelHeader

<!-- ##### SECTION Short_Description ##### -->
A header type for Camel

<!-- ##### SECTION Long_Description ##### -->
<para>
A #TnyHeader implementation implemented as a proxy for a #CamelMessageInfo.
The type doesn't use a priv pointer, it's implemented as a opaque structure.
This is done for decreasing the amount of allocations (a priv pointer is an
unnecessary allocation).
</para><para>
All kinds of dirty non-GObject-standard tricks have been applied to make this
type as fast as possible. Including modifying the TNY_HEADER() macro and
removing the GObject type-check.
