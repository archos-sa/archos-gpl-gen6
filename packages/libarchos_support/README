# Building libarchos_support

libarchos_support uses tmake to generate Makefiles. Since tmake does not
support enough parameterization and does not support "install" target, there is
an additional Makefile layer above it.

To build libarchos_support you need to:
- create a "conf.mk" file (see below)
- run "make"
- run "make install"


# The conf.mk file

To build the package, create a "conf.mk" file based on the content of
"conf.mk.sample".

You can include "conf.mk.sample" to avoid duplication. For example, here is my "conf.mk" file:

    include conf.mk.sample

    # Where is buildroot installed on the machine
    _buildroot=/home/aurelien/projects/archos/avx6/buildroot/

    # Add compiler bin/ dir to PATH
    PATH:=$(_buildroot)/build_i586/staging_dir/usr/bin/:$(PATH)

This makes it possible to override the minimum number of variables. Copying the
PATH line was still needed because it use ":=" rather than "=".

The convention used in the conf.mk files is that lowercase vars prefixed with
"_" are internal to the .mk, while uppercase vars are meant to be used by the
Makefile.


# How it works

The toplevel Makefile does the following:
1. includes conf.mk
2. runs tmplgen to generate src/libarchos_support.pro from src/libarchos_support.pro.tmpl
3. runs tmake to generate src/Makefile from src/libarchos_support.pro
4. runs make in src/
