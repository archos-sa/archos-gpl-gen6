What will happen
----------------

The generator will generate a binding for libtinymail, libtinymailui
and libtinymail-camel.

o. The .defs files are checked in as tinymail-base.defs. These can be generated 
using the Makefile in /gendefs, but this is not done during the normal course of a build.

o. Using those .defs files and the .override files, pygtk-codegen
generates -glue.c files. Those are compiled to the .so file that gets installed
in the site-packages directory.

o. A .pth file is installed in the site-packages directory
 

When .h files are added
-----------------------
You can use this little command-line to get a nice list of files the way you 
should put it in the Makefile.am:

ls DIR/*h | grep -v \\-priv | sed s/^/\\t\$\(top_srcdir\)\\//g | sed s/$/\\t\\\\/g


Special defines
---------------
You can override and define extra defines in tinymail-extra.defs,
tinymailui-extra.defs, tinymailui-gtk-extra.defs and 
tinymail-camel-extra.defs

Overrides
---------

Overrides go in the .override files
