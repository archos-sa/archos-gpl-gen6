<para>
A queue for sending messages. The queue observers the outbox that you have to give it at its
contructor. When messages get added, it'll automatically assume that those messages must be
transferred and after that is successful for a message, moved to the sentbox. The type also
implements #TnySendQueue and you can also use that API with it to add messages.
